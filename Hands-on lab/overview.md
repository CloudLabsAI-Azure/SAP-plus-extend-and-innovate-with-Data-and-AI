## Prerequisites 

Participants should have: 
Basic knowledge and understanding of the following
 
 - Basic Knowledge of SAP Systems
 - Experience with Programming
 - Understanding of AI and Machine Learning Concepts

## Architecture 

- **Basic Knowledge of SAP Systems**: Participants should have a foundational understanding of SAP’s core modules and functionalities, such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP BW (Business Warehouse), or SAP HANA. This includes familiarity with how data is stored, retrieved, and managed within the SAP ecosystem. Experience in navigating the SAP interface, accessing transactional and analytical data, and understanding business processes in SAP (like finance, logistics, and supply chain) will be beneficial for working with AI models and integrating data.

- **Experience with Programming**: To effectively interact with AI services and SAP systems, participants should be comfortable with at least one programming language. Knowledge of Python is essential as it is widely used in AI and data science for building machine learning models and handling data pipelines. Java or ABAP (SAP's proprietary programming language) can be beneficial when customizing SAP applications or integrating SAP systems with external AI services. This lab may involve writing scripts to extract and preprocess data, connect APIs, and execute AI-driven workflows.

- **Understanding of AI and Machine Learning Concepts**: A basic understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) concepts is crucial. Participants should be familiar with terms like supervised and unsupervised learning, data models, algorithms, and neural networks. Knowing how AI models are trained, validated, and deployed will help users better understand how SAP integrates with AI platforms. Familiarity with AI tools such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, or SAP’s AI services will aid in building intelligent applications and optimizing SAP workflows using predictive analytics or automation.
